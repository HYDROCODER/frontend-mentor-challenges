## My process- Mobile-First approach

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used pseudo elements to for the indicator limits, the !important tag to override styles and shaped a traingle for th tooltip using pseudo element.

### Continued development

Placing small things at appropriate places always seems like a headache. I had to struggle with placing the tooltip properly. I need to focus more on it.

### Useful resources

- [Equal height for the icons](https://moderncss.dev/equal-height-elements-flexbox-vs-grid/) - This helped me to get all the icons with the same height.
- [Shapes of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/) - This is an amazing article which helped me with the tooltip. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
