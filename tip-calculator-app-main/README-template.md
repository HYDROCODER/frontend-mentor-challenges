### What I learned

Working with forms always seems like a headache to me but I feel to be improving in this area. Styling inputs was a new thing I learnt and it was real hard. I got through it however, by using pseudo selectors, the dir attribute to take input from right to left, removing the spinners in the number inputs, checked pseudo class, using toggle for classList object to show or hide the error text, etc.. Apparently, working with numbers in js is not easy when it involves decimals. 
I did make a people icon of my own but it was not possible to use it in the input wrapper's pseudo selector so I just used font-awesome. It was a good experience.


### Useful resources
